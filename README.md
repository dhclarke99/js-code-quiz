# js-code-quiz

## Description

The purpose of this project was to gain experience using Javascript to control the flow of a webpage through the creation of an interactive timed quiz. The various acceptance criteria forced me to become familiar with important JS concepts such as timer intervals, for loops, Event Listeners, conditional statements and more. The setup of this quiz allows a user to test their knowledge of the NBA in a timed fashioned, and track their progress through the display of highscores.



## Installation

No installation required. Simply load the webpage and click the start button.

## Usage

Load the webpage and click start to begin the quiz. Click the multiple choice button you believe to be the correct answer in order to move to the next question. Be careful, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer for each wrong question! Your final score is equal to the time left on the clock upon completion of the quiz.
